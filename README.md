# Projects
Random projects I coded that I think are interesting. The projects with multiple files are kept in another folder.
Written in Javascript, Python, and Processing.

# Javascript
Javscript is the first programming language I ever learned. Most projects make use of a canvas.

# Python
Many of my Python projects are bascially pen-and-paper games recreated in ASCII.

# Processing
Processing is a new language I am not quite familiar yet, so don't judge!
